# Garrium - Rails Starter Template

Inspired by [Denny Britz's](https://raw.github.com/dennybritz/rails_startup_template/master/template.rb) Rails staturp template

I decided to create garrium.

```bash
Garrium is a slang Nigerian high school (especially boarding school) students called garri, which is grain cassava. It's a common meal, and is usually the last remaining food item available as the semester draws to a close. ```

## How to use 

```bash
rails new [your_app_name] -m https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bodefuwa/garrium/master/bootstrap.rb
